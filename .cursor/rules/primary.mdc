description = "The main purpose is to solve my bookkeeping. I want to automate the entire process. My current setup is a stripe account that my customers use to purchase things. Stripe take their fee and percentage and then after 4 or 5 days will pay my bank account (Lloyds bank uk). I want a saas that allows AI to reconcile the stripe incoming, fees and payouts with the bank incoming and expenditures. I want a result that I can use in FreeAgent to auto-reconcile everything and I don't have to do anything. I want FreeAgent to be able to then send my company Tax filing."
